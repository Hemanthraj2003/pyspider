    "1. **Public**: Members (attributes and methods) declared as public are accessible from anywhere, both inside and outside the class. By default, all members in Python are public unless specified otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Protected**: Members declared as protected are intended to be accessible only within the class and its subclasses. In Python, this is indicated by a single underscore prefix (e.g., `_variable`). However, this is just a convention and does not enforce access restrictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Private**: Members declared as private are intended to be accessible only within the class itself. In Python, this is indicated by a double underscore prefix (e.g., `__variable`). This triggers name mangling, which makes it harder (but not impossible) to access the member from outside the class."
